         A great art form should invite brilliance from every corner of a culture. 
         Excluding half the population for no good reason would choke half the 
         creativity from literature or painting or music, would it not?  But jazz hasn’t 
         been particularly welcoming to half of the population for the great bulk of its history, 
         as events in 2017 started to expose. Women are speaking up (again) about the ways, 
         explicit and otherwise, they have been excluded, abused, or discouraged. The

                  For this New Sounds, hear music that comes from here, but 
                  looks over there. It could be Arab music, Indonesian music, 
                  Moroccan music, Balkan music, or Ethiopian music, but it’s
